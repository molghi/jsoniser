# React JS: JSONISER

JSONISER is a simple and minimalist text-to-JSON converter.

It features two inputs: one for keys (|-separated) and another (a textarea) for values (each line representing a set of values, separated by |).

It provides two actions: Preview (opens a modal) and Export (downloads as JSON).

Fast, functional, and easy to use.
