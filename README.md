# React JS: JSONISER

JSONISER is a simple and minimalist text-to-JSON converter.

It features two inputs: one for keys (|-separated) and another (a textarea) for values (each line representing a set of values, separated by |).

It provides three actions: Preview (opens a modal), Export (downloads as JSON), and Reset.

Upon filling the textarea, it shows the number of entries to be generated and the textarea line numbers.

Also, it shows errors and notifications if the inputs have issues or duplicate entries.

Users don't need to provide an ID â€” it will be generated automatically.

JSONISER is fast, functional, and easy to use.
